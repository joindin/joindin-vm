Quick way to get the platform for joind.in development set up

This repository provides a vagrant virtual machine so you can start contributing quickly. Joind.in is a big project, so there a few parts involved. 

## Getting Started
1. Fork the following joind.in repository
	- [joind.in](https://github.com/joindin/joind.in)
	- [joindin-api](https://github.com/joindin/joindin-api)
	- [joindin-web2](https://github.com/joindin/joindin-web2)
	- [joindin-vm](https://github.com/joindin/joindin-vm)
1. Clone joindin-vm 

		git clone git@github.com:%%YourGitHubId%%/joindin-vm.git --recursive

1. Execute the script that will clone the other 3 repository from your forks

		php scripts/cloneRepository.php


1. Start the VM
    vagrant up

1. Add hostname to /etc/hosts.
   If you are on Linux, run this:

        echo "\n127.0.0.1 dev.joind.in api.dev.joind.in web2.dev.joind.in" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   
   If you are on OSX, run this:

        echo "127.0.0.1 dev.joind.in api.dev.joind.in web2.dev.joind.in" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

   If you are on Windows, run this on the cmd line

        echo 127.0.0.1 dev.joind.in api.dev.joind.in web2.dev.joind.in >> %SYSTEMDRIVE%\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts
1. Browse to the sites
	- For the joind.in site: http://dev.joind.in:8080/

## Running the tests
To install the testing tools in the VM 
1. Edit the file `puppet/manifests/params.pp`. Change the value of $tests to true. 
1. Re provision the VM. If the VM is not on, run `vagrant up`, if it's on, run `vagrant provision`
1. Wait for the testing tools to be installed. This will take a few minutes.
1. Run the joind.in tests with this command from inside the VM  
```
        cd /vagrant/joind.in && phing
```  
1. Run the joindin-api tests with this command from inside the VM  
```
        cd /vagrant/joindin-api && phing
```  
1. Run the joindin-web2 tests with this command from inside the VM  
```
        cd /vagrant/joindin-web2 && phing
```
